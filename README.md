# Malware Classification on grayscale malware images using Convolutional Neural Networks

### The proposed work is used for classification of malware images obtained from Malevis dataset : A Dataset for Vision Based Malware Recognition
### Malevis dataset involves totally 9100 training and 5126 validation RGB images. All the training classes involve 350 image samples while validation set have various number of images. Since the nature of the malware detection/recognition is based on discriminating legitimate ones from the malware, we provided a fairly larger set for "legitimate" samples during validation example (350 vs 1482)

# The performance of the model is : Training accuracy - 98.9% , Validation accuracy - 87 %

### The model has been tested on real-time backdoor executables prepared using meterpreter reverse-shell-http payload which is represented in the form of a byte image
