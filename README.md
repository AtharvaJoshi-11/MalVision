# Malevis dataset is aimed for researchers to supply a RGB based ground truth dataset in order to evaluate their vision based multi-class malware recognition studies.

### Malevis dataset involves totally 9100 training and 5126 validation RGB images. All the training classes involve 350 image samples while validation set have various number of images. Since the nature of the malware detection/recognition is based on discriminating legitimate ones from the malware, we provided a fairly larger set for "legitimate" samples during validation example (350 vs 1482)
